# Introduction

Enhanced elements started as a private project to reduce the amount of time needed to add basic functionalities to HTML elements, such as showing and hiding a password field value and filtering out characters in a text field.
Since then it has grown into a full-fledged component library with a focus on providing useful functionalities for any project.

## Why should I use Enhanced Elements?

Enhanced elements is a component library for Vue. It adds functionality to HTML elements while maintaining all that these elements already provide. Simply put, you can use Enhanced Elements to supercharge your usual HTML elements while still being in control of their look and feel.

## Basic example

This is what using a component would look like. You can find a more detailed description in the [Getting Started](/getting-started) page.
