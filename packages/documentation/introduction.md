# Introduction

VueTags started as a private project to reduce the amount of time needed to add basic functionalities to HTML elements, such as showing and hiding a password field value and filtering out characters in a text field.
Since then it has grown into a full-fledged component library with a focus on providing useful functionalities for any project.

VueTags is a component library for Vue. It adds functionality to HTML elements while maintaining all that these elements already provide. Simply put, you can use VueTags to supercharge your usual HTML elements while still being in control of their look and feel.

## Why should I use VueTags?

If you're tired of adding the same functionality to HTML elements, if you use UI libraries for additional functionality but don't want to be forced to use their styling, this is the library for you. It is a low-level library created to reduce the amount of (repetitive) work that you do on most projects.

## What does VueTags do?

VueTags provides extensions of native HTML elements. What this means is that you can use a VueTags element (such as the `<text-input />`) as if it were a normal `<input type="text" />`. It will still keep all functionality, attributes and accessability that the native HTML element has, including the auto-completion in your IDE.

### What do VueTags provide?

The main difference that VueTags provide is additional functions on top of the native HTML elements. For example; the `text-input` has additional attributes where you can provide filters (that filter out specific characters during input), modifiers (that transform your input) and validators (that validate your value). Additionally it provides functions that can programmatically triggered to perform actions such as focusing the element and triggering the validation.
